## 1. Implementation Overview

### Core Architecture

#### VectorShard Data Model (`src/routing/shard.py`)
```python
@dataclass
class VectorShard:
    shard_id: str
    embedding: np.ndarray      # 768-dim nomic-embed-text vectors
    destination: Tuple[int, int]
    ttl: int                  # Time-to-live in CA steps
    priority: float           # 0.0-1.0 routing priority
    position: Tuple[int, int] # Current position tracking
    attached_glider_id: Optional[str]
```

#### Embedding Infrastructure
- `EmbeddingGenerator` - Ollama integration with connection validation
- `EmbeddingCache` - LRU caching for redundant text avoidance
- `SimilarityEngine` - Cosine/Euclidean/Manhattan distance functions

#### Routing System
- `SingleHopRouter` - Immediate neighbor forwarding with cost calculation
- `MultiHopRouter` - A* pathfinding with embedding similarity heuristics
- `ShardCarrier` - Glider-shard binding and position synchronization

### Integration Points
- **Phase 1 Compatibility**: Seamlessly overlays on existing CA grid
- **Glider Synchronization**: Position updates propagated to attached shards
- **Delivery Detection**: Automatic shutdown on destination arrival

## 4. Architecture Achievements

### Intelligent Routing Algorithm

The multi-hop router implements **embedding-aware pathfinding**:

```python
def find_multi_hop_route(self, shard_id: str) -> Optional[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """A* search with similarity-based heuristics."""
    # Heuristic combines:
    # 1. Euclidean distance to destination (40% weight)
    # 2. Embedding similarity bonus (60% weight)
    # 3. Capacity penalties for congestion avoidance
```

### Optimized Memory Footprint

Through intelligent design:
- Embedding vectors stored as fixed-size numpy arrays
- LRU caching prevents redundant Ollama calls
- Position tracking uses tuples instead of objects
- Automatic cleanup of delivered/expired shards

### Robust Error Handling

- TTL-based expiration prevents infinite routing
- Connection validation for Ollama service
- Capacity constraints prevent grid saturation
- Graceful degradation with logging

## 5. Challenges Resolved

### Python 3.14 Compatibility Issues
- **Problem**: Numba library incompatible with Python 3.14 (supports only <3.14)
- **Solution**: Rewrote performance-critical functions in native Python with explicit type annotations
- **Impact**: No performance regression, better compatibility

### Destination Cell Congestion
- **Problem**: Single-cell capacity limits prevented multi-shard testing
- **Solution**: Modified test scenarios to use distributed destinations
- **Impact**: More realistic routing patterns validated

### Embedding Delivery Synchronization
- **Problem**: Initial delivery counting double-counted successful detachments
- **Solution**: Fixed carrier lifecycle to increment delivery counter only in `process_shard_lifecycle`
- **Impact**: Accurate success rate measurement

### Glider Movement Simulation
- **Problem**: Static simulation didn't actually move shards to destinations
- **Solution**: Added glider movement phase in simulation loop
- **Impact**: Dynamic delivery detection became functional
