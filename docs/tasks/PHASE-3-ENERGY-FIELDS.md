# Phase 3: Energy Fields and Emergent Dynamics

**CyberMesh - 3-Tier Memory Architecture**
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** **Specification Draft**

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 introduces **energy fields** - the third and final tier of CyberMesh. Dynamic energy gradients propagate through the CA substrate, creating attractive and repulsive forces that influence glider movement and routing decisions. This creates emergent, adaptive behavior where the CA substrate actively shapes memory routing through learned energy patterns.

Energy fields represent the system's "intuition" - learned patterns that guide gliders toward optimal routes and create stable attractors for efficient routing. This final tier transforms CyberMesh from a reactive routing system into a self-organizing, adaptive memory architecture.

## Detailed Requirements

### Energy Field Fundamentals

**Energy Field Structure:**
- **Grid representation**: 2D array of floating-point energy values (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Cell connectivity**: Moore neighborhood (8 neighbors) for energy diffusion
- **Temporal decay**: Energy dissipates over time (configurable decay rate)
- **Source placement**: Energy sources established at routing destinations and waypoints

**Energy Dynamics:**
```python
class EnergyField:
    """Dynamic energy gradients affecting CA glider behavior."""
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int, decay_rate: float = 0.95):
        self.energy_grid: np.ndarray = np.zeros((height, width))
        self.decay_rate = decay_rate
        self.sources: Dict[Tuple[int, int], float] = {}

    def add_source(self, pos: Tuple[int, int], energy: float = 1.0):
        """Add an energy source at specified position."""
        self.sources[pos] = energy
        self.energy_grid[pos] = energy

    def diffuse(self, steps: int = 1):
        """Propagate energy through CA grid using diffusion equation."""
        for step in range(steps):
            # Convolve with diffusion kernel
            diffused = scipy.signal.convolve2d(
                self.energy_grid, diffusion_kernel, mode='same', boundary='wrap'
            )
            self.energy_grid = diffused * self.decay_rate

    def get_gradient(self, pos: Tuple[int, int]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
        """Compute energy gradient vector at position."""
        y, x = pos
        # Sobel operator for gradient computation
        dy = np.gradient(self.energy_grid, axis=0)[y, x]
        dx = np.gradient(self.energy_grid, axis=1)[y, x]
        return (dx, dy)
```

### Energy-Driven Glider Behavior

**Glider Energy Coupling:**
- **Gradient following**: Gliders prefer moves that follow energy gradients (uphill/downhill)
- **Energy momentum**: Gliders maintain directional tendencies based on gradient fields
- **Adaptive strength**: Energy influence strength configured per glider/situation
- **Bypass capability**: Gliders can override energy fields for critical routing

**Modified Glider Evolution:**
```python
def evolve_with_energy(glider_pattern: np.ndarray,
                      energy_gradient: Tuple[float, float],
                      energy_weight: float = 0.3) -> List[np.ndarray]:
    """Generate glider movement probabilities biased by energy gradients."""

    # Standard Conway evolution
    standard_moves = standard_glider_evolution(glider_pattern)

    # Energy-biased probabilities
    energy_scores = []
    for move in standard_moves:
        # Score move based on alignment with energy gradient
        gradient_alignment = compute_alignment(move, energy_gradient)
        energy_scores.append(gradient_alignment)

    # Bias selection probabilities
    biased_probs = bias_probabilities(standard_moves, energy_scores, energy_weight)
    return select_moves_with_bias(standard_moves, biased_probs)
```

### Energy-Aware Routing Integration

**Enhanced Pathfinding:**
- **A* heuristic enhancement**: Include energy gradient strength in cost calculations
- **Route reinforcement**: Successful routes increase energy along path
- **Congestion avoidance**: High-traffic areas create repulsive energy fields
- **Dynamic reconfiguration**: Routes adapt to changing energy landscapes

**MultiHopRouter Integration:**
```python
def find_energy_aware_route(self, shard_id: str,
                           energy_field: EnergyField,
                           energy_weight: float = 0.5) -> Optional[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """Find optimal route incorporating energy field gradients."""

    # Standard A* search
    base_path = self.find_multi_hop_route(shard_id, max_hops=10)

    if base_path:
        # Enhance with energy field analysis
        energy_enhanced_path = self.optimize_with_energy(base_path, energy_field, energy_weight)
        return energy_enhanced_path

    return base_path
```

### Learning and Adaptation

**Energy Reinforcement Learning:**
- **Route success boosts**: Successful routing paths increase energy along route
- **Failure penalties**: Failed routes create temporary repulsive fields
- **Long-term learning**: Energy patterns persist beyond individual routing events
- **Drift prevention**: Energy decay prevents outdated patterns from dominating

**Adaptive Energy Management:**
```python
def reinforce_route_success(route_path: List[Tuple[int, int]],
                           energy_field: EnergyField,
                           reinforcement_strength: float = 0.1):
    """Strengthen energy field along successful route."""

    for pos in route_path:
        # Add positive reinforcement
        energy_field.add_energy(pos, reinforcement_strength)

        # Also strengthen neighboring positions
        for neighbor in get_moore_neighbors(pos):
            energy_field.add_energy(neighbor, reinforcement_strength * 0.3)
```
